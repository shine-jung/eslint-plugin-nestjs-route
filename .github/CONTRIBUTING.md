# Contributing to eslint-plugin-nestjs-route

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eslint-plugin-nestjs-route.git
cd eslint-plugin-nestjs-route

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## Testing

We use Jest for testing. Please ensure that:

- All existing tests pass
- New functionality includes appropriate tests
- Test coverage remains high (>85%)

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

## Code Style

- We use ESLint and TypeScript
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Adding New Rules

When adding a new ESLint rule:

1. Create the rule file in `src/rules/`
2. Add comprehensive tests in `tests/`
3. Update the main `src/index.ts` file
4. Update documentation in `README.md`
5. Add examples in the documentation

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue using the bug report template.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)
